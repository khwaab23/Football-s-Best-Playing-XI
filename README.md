Visualizing the Best Football Playing Eleven
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing player attributes and team formations in football to determine the best playing eleven using advanced data visualization techniques and machine learning models. The analysis helps identify key players for specific positions based on their performance metrics and provides predictive insights into match outcomes.

Problem Statement
Predicting the best playing eleven for football matches and determining whether the home team would win, using detailed player statistics and match data spanning years 2000-2016.

Features
Player Analysis: Visualization of player attributes such as passing accuracy, heatmaps for on-field activity, and position-specific performance metrics.
Team Analysis: Creation of variables specific to player roles (e.g., Goalkeeping, Forward) and ranking the top players for each position.
Match Outcome Prediction: Utilizing Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost classifiers to predict match outcomes with a maximum accuracy of 98.30%.
Tools and Libraries
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and JSON handling for dataset preprocessing.
Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Combined datasets from 2000-2016 and converted categorical attributes into binary variables.
Removed irrelevant or redundant data to enhance model efficiency.
Visualization:

Created plots for player activities (e.g., heatmaps, bar graphs).
Visualized team formations to identify optimal strategies.
Machine Learning:

Trained models using Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost.
Evaluated model performance using accuracy and F1 score metrics.
Results
Achieved an accuracy of 98.30% using Random Forest for predicting match outcomes.
Identified top-performing players for various positions and presented the ideal playing eleven with substitutes.
Demonstrated insights through engaging visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and positional heatmaps.
Key Visualizations
Player pass heatmaps (successful vs unsuccessful passes).
Positional rankings for goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders, and forwards.
Match outcome predictions with precision metrics.
Future Work
Expand the dataset for enhanced generalizability.
Explore more advanced machine learning models to improve predictive performance.
Integrate real-time player and match data for dynamic predictions.
